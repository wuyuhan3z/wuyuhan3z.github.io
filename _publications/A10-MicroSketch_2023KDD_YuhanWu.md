excerpt: ' High-accuracy real-time data stream estimations are critical for various applications, and sliding-window-based techniques have attracted wide attention. However, existing solutions struggle to achieve high accuracy, generality, and low memory usage simultaneously. To overcome these limitations, we present MicroscopeSketch, a high-accuracy sketch framework. Our key technique, called adaptive zooming, dynamically adjusts the granularity of counters to maximize accuracy while minimizing memory usage. By applying MicroscopeSketch to three specific tasks—frequency estimation, top-𝑘 frequent items discovery, and top-𝑘 heavy changes identification—we demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, reducing errors by roughly 4 times for frequency estimation and 3 times for identifying top-𝑘 items. The relevant source code is available in a GitHub repository. '
